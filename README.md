# React Native Yoco
The Yoco SDK allows app developers to integrate with Yoco card machines to accept in-person payments from within their application. The most common scenario is to accept Yoco payments from within your Point of Sale application.

This react native module is a wrapper around the native Yoco SDKs for iOS and Android, powered by **Expo Modules**.

# Limitations

- Android only (iOS coming soon)

# Requirements

- Please see the [Yoco documentation](https://developer.yoco.com/) for the latest requirements.
- This is an Expo Module, therefore you need to install Expo in your project. Please see the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) for more information on this.
