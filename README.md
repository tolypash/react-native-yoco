# React Native Yoco
The Yoco SDK allows app developers to integrate with Yoco card machines to accept in-person payments from within their application. The most common scenario is to accept Yoco payments from within your Point of Sale application.

This react native module is a wrapper around the native Yoco SDKs for iOS and Android, powered by Expo Modules.
